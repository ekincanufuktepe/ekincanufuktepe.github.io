I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and a Research Assistant at Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH). My research interests are Software Testing, Software Security and Analysis. You can also have a look at my [CV](CV/EkincanUFUKTEPE_CV.pdf) as well.


Here are the [lectures](lectures/prevLectures.md) I have assisted and taught before.

Please check out the tools I developed on my github profile and [published papers](publication/papers.md).
