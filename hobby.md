### Hobbies  

#### Music 
When I have time, I love playing my 5-string electric bass guitar. But, when my neighbors starts to complain about the noise, I switch to my acustic 5-string bass guitar or to my classical guitar. Currently, I working on mastering my new tenor ukulele! I really enjoy good music, but I really love playing Rock music! Here are some of the videos 

This video was taken while I was working at SAP Labs in France Mougins in a Summer Music Party event playing [Iron Maiden - Wasting Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU9xTIbm8Do&list=UUYcDi6Yc50_vAtXOoYjgzXQ)

This video is very special to me. When I was undergrad senior student we participated our university's music competition in Rock Category, and we won 1st prize! Enjoy [Porcupine Tree - Sound of Muzak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAG_xLVv3ck)
